## Result:

__Different search algorithms such as Breadth first search, Depth first search, Iterative deepening and A-star algorithms were implemented.__

A-star based heuristic approach is proven to be the best for the 8 puzzle game.

#### Highlight of this imp√ºlementation: 
The A- star algorithm was able to solve upto depth level 31 (31 moves to reach goal state).

#### A- star output:
Goal node:
